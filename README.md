# Tetris-Game - Nitya Patel
Tetris Game (WPF)  A classic Tetris game built in C# using WPF. Play and enjoy the falling blocks, rotate them, clear lines, and try to achieve the highest score! This was one of my highschool projects, built in collaboration as part of a class project, with contributions in coding game logic and implementing the GUI.

- Line Clearing: Clears full rows automatically
- Score Tracking: Increases score as you clear rows
- Game Over
